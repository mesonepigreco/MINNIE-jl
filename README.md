This is a julia transposition of the Multidimensional ab Initio Neural Network Interatomic Engine, originally written in C++ and python.
It is a custom julia implementation of the Behler Parinello Neural Network for Interatomic Potentials that exploits the multiple dispatch and automatic differentiation to provide a way to optimize the hyperparameters of the symmetric functions together with the atomic network to improve the description of the system.
